    <h2>World's best homemade pancakes</h2>
    <p>These buttermilk pancakes are passed down from my grandmother, who was fully Scandinavian. They are light and fluffy, and great with berry syrups. I have made these for years as a special treat, and I hope you enjoy them as much as my family has.</p>
